## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains the **Epic Template** used to capture and define high-level initiatives and software requirements. Originally adapted from the **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)**, this template is ongoingly refined to meet the scientific and technical needs of the **ISIS Neutron and Muon Source**.

### 🔗 Part of the Epic Kanban System
This project is designed to work in tandem with our workflow definitions:
* **[Kanban-system-templates](https://github.com/EpicKanbanSystem/Kanban-system-templates)**: Defines the lifecycle and [Kanban States](https://github.com/EpicKanbanSystem/Kanban-system-templates/blob/main/Kanban-States-Definitions.md) through which these Epics progress.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Scientific Alignment:** Dedicated sections for scientific impact, methodology, and research context.
* **Agile Integration:** Seamlessly maps to SAFe Portfolio and Program levels.
* **Automated Word Export:** Powered by GitHub Actions and Pandoc. Any change to the Markdown template automatically generates a polished `.docx` file for stakeholder distribution.
* **Consistency:** Ensures software projects that use the template follow the same way of documentating large software needs.
